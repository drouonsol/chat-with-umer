Errors
drou.SOL — Today at 10:55 AM

umerhashimqureshi — Today at 10:58 AM
These are file errors, I’ll try different ways later and will let you know
drou.SOL — Today at 10:59 AM

umerhashimqureshi — Today at 12:15 PM
What was the total supply of solanawhales?
I got 5.6 back but I'm sending you 1.5 back. Because I didn't get paid for my work. Tell me if it's ok with you. I'm honest that's why I told you the accurate numbers.
umerhashimqureshi — Today at 12:22 PM
I sent 1.5 to this address
drou.SOL — Today at 1:51 PM
Any chance we could add some sol so we break even because you have recieved a total of around 5 sol and only got 3 SOL i had all the risks etc .
umerhashimqureshi — Today at 1:53 PM
I take like 3-5k for the work I did for you and didn’t say anything when I got nothing now it’s my right. I have total of 600-700$ so that’s low too but I’m ok with it as you apologized for your behavior before
drou.SOL — Today at 1:54 PM
I mean $1000 for a candy machine is a little bit high but ok
Have a great rest of your day
We said half /half
